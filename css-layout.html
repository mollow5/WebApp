      <h2> CSS를 이용한 Layout 구성 </h2>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
      <p>[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
      <p>[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
      <p>[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
      <p>css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
      <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
      <p>CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
      <p>[4]The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
      <p>This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
      <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
      <p>Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
      <p>[5]In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
